# Distribution-Wise Intervention
This is the official implementation code for our paper [Learning Distribution-wise Control in Representation Space for Language Models].

Generally, we are inspired by the fact that intervention magnitude can be controlled by multiplying a concept vector with a scalar - so why don't we learn that distribution directly? In short, this is  a **deep latent variable model + intervention** research. 

We can directly learn a distribution in latent space for different tasks.
